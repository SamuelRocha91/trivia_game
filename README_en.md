![Application Preview](./public/trivia.gif)

This project was developed as part of the Front-End module of the [Trybe](https://www.betrybe.com/) Web Development course. It is a question-and-answer game based on the **Trivia** game, built using **React** and **Redux**. The application consumes an external API to get the questions and includes a timer and score system based on the difficulty of the questions.

## Description

The goal of this project is to provide an interactive and fun experience for users by answering questions of varying difficulty levels. The application uses:

- **React** for component and page development.
- **Redux** for global state management.
- **React Router** for navigation between the game's pages, such as login, game, ranking, and feedback screens.

The system includes:

- A game interface with random questions.
- A timer to answer questions.
- A score system based on the remaining time and the question difficulty.
- Integration with the [Open Trivia Database](https://opentdb.com/) API.

## Technologies Used

- **JavaScript** (ES6+)
- **React**
- **Redux**
- **React Router**
- **CSS**
- **HTML**
- **Docker** (for application containerization)

## Features

1. **Random Questions**: The application fetches questions from the external [Open Trivia Database](https://opentdb.com/), showing one question at a time.
2. **Timer System**: Users have 30 seconds to answer each question. The answer button is disabled when the time runs out.
3. **Scoring**: The score is calculated based on the remaining time and question difficulty.
4. **Feedback System**: After answering all the questions, the player is redirected to the feedback page.
5. **Ranking**: Players can view a ranking of the highest scores.
6. **Access Token**: To play, users need a token generated when starting the game.
